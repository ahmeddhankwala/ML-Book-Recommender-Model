# ML-Book-Recommender-Model


The goal was to make a tool that suggests books you might like. We used a mix of techniques to do this, like looking at what other people like and analyzing data. First, we got three sets of info: one about books, one about what people think of them, and one about the people themselves. We cleaned up this info, making sure it was good to use.

Then, we looked into the info to see what it tells us. By putting it together, we figured out what books are popular and what kinds of people like what books. This helped us plan what to do next.

We started with a basic idea: suggesting books that most people like. After that, we tried different ways to figure out what books you might like. One way was to see if you're similar to other people who like the same books. Another way was to use a special math trick called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to guess how you'd rate a book.

We checked how well these methods worked by comparing our guesses to what people actually rated books. SVD seemed to do a good job at this.

The project stressed the importance of cleaning up data, understanding what it tells us, and picking the right methods. By putting all this together, we made a tool that suggests books tailored just for you, making it easier to find something you'll enjoy.

In short, the project shows that simple methods can make smart recommendation tools. As more and more stuff gets online, tools like these are handy for finding what you like to read.
